# More to Explore Version 1.6 release

After ~8 months of development, finally we have release our mod's update V1.6. 

This update mostly compromised of biome revamps and new game mechanics.
Regarding biomes, Bedrock's Biome system was broken, and we really were looking forward to adding new biomes to the mod. However we went with revamping current biomes due to that.
