### MtE Wiki Rewrite

We have completely redone the wiki to look more responsive and _more to explore_ themed! It's also now way easier to navigate the pages. And thanks to the Jekyll [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.com) theme, we now have a search bar (built with lunr.js) too!

### MtE update

We're looking at the end of this month here (that's a lot of procrastination).
This one's aimed at bugfixes and making it ready for 1.21 that just dropped a week-ish ago.

## New Indie Game

Look out for our new _sniper?_ project coming soon! Done by Bloxinoobie !
