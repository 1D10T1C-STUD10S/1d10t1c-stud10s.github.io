Now now, I am aware.

Adrift has been in _'development'_ for _quite_ a while now...

_**BUT**_ I bring great news, we have given it a dedicated webpage so you can play it easily! It's, of course :) _still_ in _'development'_ so do expect some buggy, raw and unfinished content (you'll find them everywhere, actually)

It even comes with a whole _wiki_ too! (WHOA, worked more on the wiki than on the _actual game_)

If you fancy playing it, check it our [here!](https://adriftapp.github.io)
